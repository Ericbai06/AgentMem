The event was really thought-provoking. I'm starting to realize that self-care is really important. It's a journey for me, but when I look after myself, I'm able to better look after my family.\nuser: [1:14 pm on 25 May, 2023]: Caroline: I totally agree, Melanie. Taking care of ourselves is so important - even if it's not always easy. Great that you're prioritizing self-care.\nassistant: [1:14 pm on 25 May, 2023]: Melanie: Yeah, it's tough. So I'm carving out some me-time each day - running, reading, or playing my violin - which refreshes me and helps me stay present for my fam!\n"

Got any tips for getting started on it?\nuser: [10:31 am on 13 October, 2023]: Caroline: Yep! Do your research and find an adoption agency or lawyer. They'll help with the process and provide all the info. Gather documents like references, financial info and medical checks. Don't forget to prepare emotionally, since the wait can be hard. It's all worth it in the end though.\nassistant: [10:31 am on 13 October, 2023]: Melanie: Thanks for the tip, Caroline. Doing research and readying myself emotionally makes sense. I'll do that. BTW, recently I had a setback. Last month I got hurt and had to take a break from pottery, which I use for self-expression and peace.\nuser: [10:31 am on 13 October, 2023]: Caroline: Oh man, sorry to hear that, Melanie. I hope you're okay. Pottery's a great way to relax, so it must have been tough taking a break. Need any help?\nassistant: [10:31 am on 13 October, 2023]: Melanie: Thanks, Caroline. It was tough, but I'm doing ok. Been reading that book you recommended a while ago and painting to keep busy.\n"
